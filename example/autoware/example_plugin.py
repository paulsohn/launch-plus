"""Example connection metadata plugin that reads per-executable interface definitions.

This example stores all interface definitions locally under ``interfaces/``,
keyed by package name.  This works for both first-party and third-party packages
— no files need to be written into the package's own share directory.

Usage:
    roscope resolve ... --plugin example/autoware/example_plugin.py

Expected directory structure
-----------------------------
example/autoware/interfaces/
└── <pkg_name>/
    ├── MyComponent.yaml     (composable node, matched by plugin class suffix)
    ├── my_node.yaml         (standalone node executable)
    └── other_node.yaml

Expected YAML format
---------------------
connections:
  ~/input/points:
    type: subscription
    qos:
      reliability: best_effort
      durability: volatile
  ~/output/objects:
    type: publisher
    qos:
      reliability: reliable
      durability: volatile
  /tf:
    type: subscription
  ~/set_parameters:
    type: service_server

Recognized types: publisher, subscription, service_client, service_server,
                  action_client, action_server.
Any other type string is warned and ignored by the resolver.
If the interface file does not exist, the node is silently skipped.

Plugin function signature
--------------------------
get_connections(*, pkg_share_path, params, pkg_name, executable=None, plugin_name=None)

Exactly one of *executable* (standalone node) or *plugin_name* (composable node)
is provided.  *pkg_name* is always provided and is the ROS package name.
